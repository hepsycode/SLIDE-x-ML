## Installation instructions

### OVERVIEW
SLIDE-x-ML is an open-source Python tool that facilitates the System-Level HW/SW Co-Design of embedded systems and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) through the creation of HW/SW ML models using machine learning frameworks and tools, including MATLAB Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (for MATLAB) and TensorFlow/Keras/PyTorch/Scikit-Learn (for Python). These HW/SW ML models can be used to evaluate HW/SW performance, select the most suitable embedded platform, and perform HW/SW trade-off analysis.

### SLIDE-x Main Components
SLIDE-x consists of the following components:

1. **00-SLIDE-x-Ingestion**: Extensible Python Dataset Ingestion component for collecting datasets generated during the SLIDE-x Profiling/Simulation framework. It also offers functionalities for implementing unified HW/SW metrics (e.g., CC4CS, CC4IR, CC4SSA, CC4OPT, Affinity), performing statistical analysis, and comparing different platforms. The SLIDE-x-Ingestion is composed of:
    - **SILDE-x-Data-Collect-Cleaning**: WIP
    - **SILDE-x-Feature-Engineering**: WIP
    - **SILDE-x-Data-Ingestion**: WIP
3. **SLIDE-x-Model-Engineering**: HW/SW ML-based component for creating System-Level HW/SW Co-Design models using machine learning frameworks and tools. The SLIDE-x-Model-Engineering is composed of:
    - **SILDE-x-Data-Analysis**: WIP
    - **SILDE-x-Data-Preparation**: WIP
    - **SILDE-x-Model-Training-and-Validation**: WIP (Best algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter tuning).
    - **SILDE-x-Model-Export**: WIP

### DOWNLOAD
SLIDE-x is open-source and freely available on GitHub: https://github.com/hepsycode/SLIDE-x-ML.

### GETTING STARTED GUIDELINES
The framework is implemented in Python3 and uses the csv, os, shutil, subprocess, tkinter libraries for internal operations. Thus, Python3 and the above-listed libraries should be installed for the framework to run properly.
